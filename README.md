# InceptionV3--based-Image-classifier-with-TransferLearning
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model, for categorizing images using transfer 
learning methods. The dataset consists of pictures of rice categorized into five groups, each representing 
types of rice. By applying transfer learning from Inception V3 the goal was to develop 
a model to accurately classify these rice images. Transfer learning allows tapping into the knowledge 
acquired by a model trained on a large dataset, which in this case is the Inception V3 model trained on the 
ImageNet dataset. Training the pre-trained Inception V3 model with the rice image dataset improved its 
capability to differentiate between different rice varieties. The project includes exploring the dataset, 
selecting a model, implementing transfer learning techniques, evaluating the model's performance, and 
providing insights into the workflow of this process. The objective is to understand how effective transfer 
learning is, in image classification tasks and assess how using a pre-trained model influences classification 
accuracy.
